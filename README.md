# fraud-detection
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using deep learning frameworks. The project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and classification models to identify anomalies in transaction data effectively.


## Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Handles imbalanced data using techniques such as oversampling or undersampling and normalizes transaction features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Provides visualizations and statistics to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.
- Machine Learning Models: Implements various classification models (e.g. Logistic Regression ,MultiLayerPerceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to predict fraud.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluates models using metrics like precision, recall, & F1-score for balanced assessment.
- Results are summarized in the pdf file (**Credit Card Fraud Detection-1.pdf**)
